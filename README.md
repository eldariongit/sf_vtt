# sf_vtt: A Street Fighter Game System for VTT Foundry

This game system is my first attempt. It was designed to play with the rules of Street Fighter: The Story Telling Game.
- Currently it consists of only a sheet for PCs. A sheet for NPCs might follow.
- As the needed attribute might vary on a skill check, I simply added a simple dice roller tool, where one can set the overall number of dice and difficulty.
- As inititative in Street Fighter changes every round, the app also provides easy to use means of entering a new initiative value and publishing it to the combat tracker.
